Implementing a 2D convolutional layer in CUDA.

Still in progress. To do:
- Run tests
- Compare optimization
## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/athp18/ConvolutionalLayers-Cuda.git
    cd ConvolutionalLayers-Cuda
    ```

2. **Create a Build Directory**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. **Run CMake**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4. **Build the Project**
    ```bash
    make
    ```

5. **Run Tests**
    ```bash
    ctest
    ```

## Usage

After building the project, you can run the convolution application as follows:

```bash
./conv2D
